<p id="checking">For beginner writers, it is better to stick to short, to-the-point sentences which clearly express your point. Long, rambling sentences can very quickly become incoherent or fall victim to grammatical errors, so try to avoid them until you gain more experience as a writer.As per the induction schedule, today is the boot camp, where in you are required to equip yourselves with the softwares necessary in the further stages of the process. As a part of this, you are provided with links to install the softwares Solidworks 16, ANSYS 18.1 and Arduino along with a few tutorial videos on how to use them. Feel free to explore beyond what is given and stay tuned for more updates.
